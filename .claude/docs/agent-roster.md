# Agent Roster

The following agents are available. Each has a dedicated definition file in
`.claude/agents/`. Use the agent best suited to the task at hand. When a task
spans multiple domains, the coordinating agent (usually `producer` or the
domain lead) should delegate to specialists.

Agent frontmatter model/effort/maxTurns are Claude Code metadata and do not
apply to Codex workers. Codex uses its configured model; see codex-workers.md.
